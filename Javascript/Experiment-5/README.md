# Experiment 5 – Dynamic Product Filter

This experiment focuses on building an **interactive product filtering system** using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The feature allows users to filter a list of products in real time based on categories selected from a dropdown menu, reinforcing skills in DOM manipulation, event handling, and accessible UI design.

## 🎯 Objective
To create a web-based component where a `<select>` dropdown controls the visibility of products categorized through `data-*` attributes, ensuring a dynamic and user-friendly filtering experience without reloading the page.

## 🛠️ Key Components

### HTML
- **Dropdown (`<select id="categoryFilter">`)** – Acts as the filter trigger with options: All, Clothing, Electronics, Books.  
- **Product List (`<ul id="productList">`)** – Contains filterable items.  
- **List Items (`<li class="product-item" data-category="...">`)** – Each product is tagged with a category for filtering.  

### JavaScript
- Uses **`DOMContentLoaded`** to ensure safe execution.  
- Selects elements via **`getElementById`** and **`querySelectorAll`**.  
- Reads product categories with **`getAttribute('data-category')`**.  
- Filters dynamically by toggling **`style.display`**.  
- Reuses a single **`applyFilter()`** function for initial and event-driven updates.  

### CSS
- **`.container`** – Creates a bordered rectangular box with padding, centered on the page.  
- **`#productList`** – Uses flexbox in column layout with spacing between items.  
- **`.product-item`** – Styled as card-like boxes with padding, rounded corners, and a light background.

## 🔄 Interactive Flow
1. **Page loads** → all product items are cached.  
2. **User selects a category** → script checks each item’s `data-category`.  
3. **Matching products** remain visible; others are hidden.  
4. **Default state ("All")** shows the full list.  

---

## ✅ Valid & Invalid Cases
- **Valid:** Selecting “Clothing” → shows only T-Shirt and Jeans.  
- **Invalid:** Missing `data-category` attribute → product cannot be filtered.  
- **Error Prevention:** Dropdown always has a default value, so empty selection is impossible.  

---

## 📚 Learning Outcomes
- Practiced **DOM selection** and event handling.  
- Understood the role of **`data-*` attributes** in semantic filtering.  
- Implemented **real-time UI updates** using `style.display`.  
- Designed a clean **CSS layout** with containers and styled list items.  
- Learned to define **valid/invalid test cases** for dropdown-based filters.
